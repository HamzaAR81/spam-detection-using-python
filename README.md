# Spam Message Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting spam messages using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained to classify messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content.

## Overview

- **Objective:** To build a robust spam detection model using NLP techniques.
- **Dataset:** The model is trained on a dataset of labeled messages, where spam messages are marked as 1 and non-spam messages as 0. [data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityarajsisodiya/spam-detection-using-python)
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, WordCloud.

## Model Evaluation
  - The model's effectiveness is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - A confusion matrix provides insights into the model's performance on different classes.
